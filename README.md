A Pen created on CodePen.

The TV display you would see on Fox News. Since the interface has many different versions (e.g. one for The O’Reilly Factor, America’s Election HQ, etc.), I chose to base this Pen on the America's Newsroom one from this year (see URL in the Sass). By the way, the ticker at the bottom is not a marquee element.
